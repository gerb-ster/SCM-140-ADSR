# SCM 140 ADSR

This module is a straight up clone of the ADSR module found it the famous Roland System-100m modular synthesizer from the ’70’s. It consists of 2 identical ADSR generators with a positive and a negative output. I’ve build this some years ago, there are other simpler designs out there, however, it was a really good learning experience.
